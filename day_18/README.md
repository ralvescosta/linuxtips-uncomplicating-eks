# LinuxTips Uncomplicating EKS Day 18 - Final Project 01 - ArgoCD and Multiple Cluster Management on AWS

In this lesson, you will explore how ArgoCD can be used to manage multiple EKS clusters in an active/active model, ensuring high availability, scalability, and centralized governance. We will learn how to organize the environment into application shards, making it easier to segment by domain, team, or region. We will also see how ArgoCD can be used to install addons and Helm Charts in a declarative and standardized way, maintaining consistency across clusters. By the end of this lesson, you will have mastered how to manage complex and distributed environments with ArgoCD, orchestrating multiple clusters with full control, visibility, and end-to-end automation for the final project.
