# LinuxTips Uncomplicating EKS Day 08 - Ingress e Exposit: Nginx Ingress Controller

In this eighth lesson, you will learn how to integrate the Nginx Ingress Controller with your EKS environment, enhancing the exposure of your services with the best of both worlds. We will implement an external ingress that will work in conjunction with the AWS Load Balancer Controller, taking advantage of the advanced Target Group Binding feature to direct traffic through Network Load Balancers (NLBs). This way, you combine the high performance and throughput of layer 4 of NLBs with the flexibility and advanced routing power of layer 7 offered by Nginx Ingress. By completing this lesson, you will have a simple, versatile and high-performance solution for exposing applications with complex routing, ensuring operational efficiency and scalability of your Kubernetes cluster. The most interesting thing is that this lesson can be reused for any type of Ingress Controller, use your imagination to implement other flavors in the same way!
