# LinuxTips Uncomplicating EKS Day 19 - Final Project 02 - Observability Cluster - Grafana Dashboards and Grafana Loki

In this lesson, we will kick off our final observability project by building a dedicated cluster for monitoring and analyzing logs on EKS. You will learn how to deploy Grafana with persistent dashboards on EFS, ensuring that your configurations and visualizations are maintained even after reboots. We will then implement Grafana Loki in a scalable and resilient mode, using S3 as the storage backend and configuring autoscaling to support large volumes of logs. We will cover both ingesting large amounts of logs and indexing queries. We will also see how to securely expose the environment and how to integrate multiple clusters into the observability pipeline, using Fluent Bit for centralized log shipping.
