# LinuxTips Uncomplicating EKS

## What You Will Learn

**Optimized Infrastructure on AWS**: Learn to plan and provision networks, VPCs, and subnets with high availability, security, and scalability, using infrastructure as code with Terraform.

**EKS Cluster Creation and Management**: Configure Kubernetes clusters with EC2, Fargate, and Karpenter, including security practices, permissions (IAM), and automatic scaling strategies.

**Automated Deployments with GitOps**: Implement rolling, blue/green, and canary deployments using Argo Rollouts and ArgoCD, focusing on production environments and reliable pipelines.

**Complete Observability**: Monitor applications with Prometheus, Grafana, Loki, Tempo, and Mimir, creating dashboards and alerts to ensure complete visibility of your cluster.

**Storage and AWS Integrations**: Use persistent volumes with EBS, EFS, and S3 (CSI), manage secrets with AWS Secrets Manager, and integrate your services with ALB, NLB, and RDS.

**Service Mesh and Traffic Control**: Implement Istio for intelligent routing, resilience, and service telemetry. Configure ingress with ALB, NLB, and Nginx.

**Security and Production Best Practices**: Apply RBAC, Network Policies, scalability with KEDA, and strategies to prevent failures, secret leaks, and production bottlenecks.
