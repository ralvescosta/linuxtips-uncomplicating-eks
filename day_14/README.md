# LinuxTips Uncomplicating EKS Day 14 - Advanced Application Autoscaling with Keda Autoscaler

In this fourteenth lesson, you will master advanced and intelligent application autoscaling techniques with the Keda Autoscaler. We will migrate from traditional HPAs (Horizontal Pod Autoscalers) to the power and flexibility of Keda, allowing you to scale your applications much faster and more accurately, using not only basic metrics such as CPU and Memory, but also advanced triggers. You will learn how to automatically scale workloads based on scheduled events using cron schedules, dynamically respond to external metrics from Prometheus, react in real time to the number of transactions received, and even automatically scale based on messages available in Amazon SQS. By the end of this lesson, you will have full control over the scaling of your applications, ensuring high performance, resource savings, and a user experience that is always stable and predictable.
