# LinuxTips Uncomplicating EKS Day 04 - Computing: Clusters Full Fargate

In this fourth lesson, we will revolutionize the way you manage workloads in Kubernetes using a fully serverless approach with Fargate. You will learn how to implement an EKS cluster 100% based on Fargate nodes, completely eliminating the need to manage servers, which significantly simplifies your operations. We will clearly address the tradeoffs of this model, identifying the main challenges and presenting practical solutions for each of them. By the end of this lesson, you will be able to decide when and how to use Fargate in an intelligent and efficient way, taking advantage of the full potential of Kubernetes in a truly serverless environment.
