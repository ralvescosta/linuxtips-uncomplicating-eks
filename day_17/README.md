# LinuxTips Uncomplicating EKS Day 17 - Deployment with ArgoCD and ChartMuseum

In this class, you will take an important step towards the automation and full governance of your deployments with Kubernetes by integrating ArgoCD into your environment. Together, we will perform the first deployment using ArgoCD in a simple and direct way, publishing the Helm Chart created in the previous class in an internal repository with ChartMuseum, within the cluster itself. From there, we will use ArgoCD to manage the application lifecycle in a declarative, secure and visual way. In addition, we will integrate Argo Rollouts into the ArgoCD interface, unifying the management of Blue/Green Deployments, Canary Releases and metrics analysis in one place. By the end of this class, you will have a complete, visual, standardized deployment pipeline, ready to operate with excellence in mission-critical environments.
